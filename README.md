# CSS-in-JS Workshop

This is the repository for use in the CSS-in-JS workshop. In the workshop we'll go through techniques for migrating from stylesheets to CSS-in-JS and mechanisms for applying styles via JS.

## Getting Started

There's 4 projects within this repo, prefixed 1-4, which we'll go through in order as part of the workshop. To get each project ready, please `yarn install` inside each folder to install dependencies. To run a project, simply `yarn dev` from inside the folder.
